Alcatraz helper app
==============================

A mac app that automatically adds uuids for all installed Xcode apps to Alcatraz compatibility list.

Move it to /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Applications/
And you can run it from Xcode -> Open Developer Tool (need to restart Xcode at first time)
